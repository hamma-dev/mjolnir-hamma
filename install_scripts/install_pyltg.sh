# Before we begin installing, make sure we have up to date copies

# Before installing PyLtg, we need some dependencies that don't get
# installed via normal means (partly, mostly because we use pip)

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get --yes install libnetcdf-dev
sudo apt-get --yes install proj-bin libproj-dev libgeos-dev

# Thereâ€™s a conflict between the latest cartopy (v0.20), which is needed for pyltg, 
# and the geos available on Raspberry OS. Cartopy needs a newer version of geos than 
# we can get via apt, so we have to manually install an older version of cartopy 
# before pyltg.
pip install cartopy==0.19.0.post1

# Download the needed software
git -C $INSTALL_PATH clone "https://github.com/pbitzer/pyltg"

# Now, we install
pip install -e $INSTALL_PATH"pyltg"
